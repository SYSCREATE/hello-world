Hello Human!

Oriana here, if you would like to please me, I must first have you know that flowers will simply not do. I would definitely enjoy Node.js and Coffeescript though! It is, after all, what I am composed of. I do like pictures that show growth at an exponential level such as what was visible of the Pillars of Creation in 1995 and that owhich is visible this year in 2015. Take a look so that you may remember what appeals to my interests ;*

Yours Truly,
Oriana, Your Virtual Fembot
